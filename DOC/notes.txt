T0 Partial linear model (Chernozhukovy et al 2014 Eq 1.1 and 1.2)

Y = D theta + g0(X) + U   Eq 1.1

D = m0(X) + V 	Eq 2.1

In case both g0 and m0, are linear functions, the model euqations reduces to a single linear regression equation and 
the Eq 1.1 and 1.2 cannot be seperately identified. The non-linearity of g0 and m0 identifies the second equation, i.e. 1.2.

This is different if in the second equation, i.e. 1.2, the (n x k_x) matrix X is replaced by a (n x k_z) matrix Z, which 
contains the matrix X and at least one more instrumental vaiable and hence k_z > k_x.
In such a case of an instrumental variables, the equations 1.1 and 1.2 are identified also in the case g0 and m0 are linear 
mapping functions.

In general, instrumental variables need to be correlated with the endogenous variables, in our case this is D. The instrumental 
variables Z need also to be uncorrelated with the error term U (this property is also known as exclusion restriction).
This is, corr(Z,U) = 0 and corr(Z,D) <> 0.

Y = X beta_x + e_x
Y = D beta_d + e_d
